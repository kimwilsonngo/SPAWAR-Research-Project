# SPAWAR Research Project
Here is a research and development project conducted at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center in the Summer of 2018. Please see the research poster in this repository that I created with my small team of interns!

## Research?
Yes! I conducted research and development during my internship at SPAWAR in San Diego, California.

## What did I do?
I utilized my technical capabilities in order to create a new testing system for the Global Command and Control System - Maritime. This system would consist of hundreds of automated test cases that seamlessly run to verify functionality of our software.

## Outcome
Testing times were cut by an average 57%. Installation times were cut from 17 days to 5 days onboard naval vessels. This means that both Navy Sailors and SPAWAR engineers experience a reduction of time spent towards testing this software.

## Technical Details
